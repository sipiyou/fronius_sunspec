  bit 0 -> Error
  bit 1 -> Warning
  bit 2 -> Info

This bitfield is composed as a superposition for the severity-levels of all currently active events on view level ""Customer"".
If a bit is set it means that currently there is at least one active event with this severity level.
Multiple bits can be set at once indicating several active events with different severity-levels.

57,58,2,R,0x03,EvtVnd2,Vendor defined events,bitfield32,,,"""Technician"" event severity level bitfield
  bit 0 -> Error

  bit 2 -> Info

This bitfield is composed as a superposition for the severity-levels of all currently active events on view level ""Technician""
If a bit is set it means that currently there is at least one active event with this severity level.
Multiple bits can be set at once indicating several active events with different severity-levels.

View level ""Technician"" is a superset of view level ""Customer"". This means that all events visible
for view level ""Customer"" are also visible for view level ""Technician"".
