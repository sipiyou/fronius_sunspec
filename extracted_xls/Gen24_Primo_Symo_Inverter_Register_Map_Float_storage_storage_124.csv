Reference Value for maximum Charge and Discharge.
Multiply this value by InWRte to define maximum charging and OutWRte to define maximum discharging.
Every rate between this two limits is allowed.
The inverter is not fully capable of transferring power as reported by this reference value.

Please be aware that setting an invalid power window will result in a modbus exception 3 (ILLEGAL DATA VALUE).
Invalid power windows are all windows where condition:

This can happen for example if two negative values are written into InWRtg and OutWRtg and both limits are activated by StorCtl_Mod = 3.
